Notepad for programming guidelines

Graphics x and y in function calls are always from bottom left of an 800x480 canvas.  However, Touchscreen only has 479x799 pixels.  So 1, 1 is visible bottom left and 799, 479 is visible top right.  The coords 0, 0 will however show on an hdmi display.

screenXsize and screenYsize can be 1920x1080 or 1280x720, but this does not change the 800x480 drawing canvas.

fbi and vlc write to the large (720p or 1080p) canvas, so clearscreen clears the entire canvas.
